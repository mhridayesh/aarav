 The course covers the areas of Maths, Physics and Chemistry. Our course and tests are structured in a way that inculcates the habit of application of concepts thereby paving way for effective learning.
<br><br>
<strong>Objectives of the Medical Coaching course :</strong><br><br>

    The objective of this course is to make the students understand and master basic concepts in all the subjects.<br><br>
    The focus will be on encouraging students to apply the concepts learnt to real-life situations.<br><br>
    The Foundation programme will not only help children understand better what is taught in regular school classes, and hence do well in board exams but will also help them develop the acumen which will give them a distinctive edge over the rest of their peers.<br><br>
    
    
 
<strong>Course Methodology:</strong><br><br>

    Course methodology is aimed at helping the students understand the concepts thoroughly.<br><br>
    It helps them develop a logical approach to Maths, Physics and Chemistry, for more effective learning.<br><br>
    It lays stress on application of concepts.<br><br>
    The course has a comprehensive coverage of Maths, Physics and Chemistry encompassing the syllabi of the major boards (State, CBSE and ICSE).<br><br>
    
    The Supplemental Coaching Program offered by Pearson addresses this same need of creating a successful student rather than a student who is successful only in his /her end term examinations. The program unlike other tuition programs is not focused on making students score marks by making them rote learn the concepts. The program is designed to impart students with skills and concept clarity, which would lead to:<br><br>

    For each class we provide the following books<br><br>

        <li>Physics Study Material</li>
        <li>Chemistry Study Material</li>
        <li>Biology Study Material</li>
